## About

This is a recursive selection tree I made during an assignment for an internship. It utilizes React (components, states, and contexts) and was built in Next.js.![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91951395/139058199-cdb8e534-ac5e-429b-ba2f-adc7f8003021.PNG){:style="float: right;margin-right: 7px;margin-top: 7px;"}
